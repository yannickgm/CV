    <br>
    <p>Family IT technician and electronic gizmos installer since he was 5 years old starting with the original Nintendo
    Entertainment System (NES), Video Home System (VHS) and Stereo systems. Life and work experience made him a Swiss army
    knife of installations of all kinds of electronics including: computers, modems, residential and commercial routers,
    wi-fi access points, digital signal routers capturing production and manufacturing equipment signal, large outdoor custom commercial led screens, touchscreen
    kiosks, Ip cameras, television personal video recorders (PVR), basically if it comes if an electrical plug he will be able to
    install it. In his family life he‚Äôs always been the ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù family member for any issue with anything electronic from
    teaching his grandfather how to master the input/source button, helping his mother with all computer issues, and helping
    friends remotely finally getting that video game console installed and working so that the NHL tournament can finally
    begin. During his work career he developed excellent customer service skills and the ability to communicate and solve
    technical issues with anyone from a technically-challenged elderly, to a veteran technician, and from a cashier to a CEO and always 
    with an ever present smile üòä .
